Usage: $0 {-n|-d|-l}

Runs the qemu box. You must choose a mode to run in. Note that when you run this
locally, we will set the interrupt control to '^]' so that you don't
accidentally kill qemu with '^C' (and so that you can kill processes inside
qemu).

  -n    Normal mode: this is what remote is gonna run as
  -l    Local mode: run qemu box as root for ease of testing. Also allows you to
        enable qemu monitoring (not that it would be much use)
  -d    Debug mode:  run qemu box as root, AND enables a gdbserver endpoint on
        port 1234.
